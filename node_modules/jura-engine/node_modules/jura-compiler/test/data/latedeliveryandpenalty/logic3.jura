Late Delivery and Penalty. In case of delayed delivery[{" except for Force Majeure cases,":? forceMajeure}] the Seller shall pay to the Buyer for every [{penaltyDuration}] of delay penalty amounting to [{penaltyPercentage}]% of the total value of the Equipment whose delivery has been delayed. Any fractional part of a [{fractionalPart}] is to be considered a full [{fractionalPart}]. The total amount of penalty shall not however, exceed [{capPercentage}]% of the total value of the Equipment involved in late delivery. If the delay is more than [{termination}], the Buyer is entitled to terminate this Contract.
